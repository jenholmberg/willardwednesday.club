    <h1>üìù Willard Wednesday log</h1>    
    <h2>üñºÔ∏è Wednesday, July 24th 2024</h2>
    <p> Report: 7 people, bubbles, white claws, other food in the picture below. </p>
    <p> I was late to this willard wednesday, but I was early compared to everyone else.</p>
    <p> We made bubbles and stayed pretty late, until 9 or so. </p>
    <p> Many people were in the park on this day. </p>

    <h2>üñºÔ∏è Wednesday, July 17th 2024</h2>
    <p> They're all really good ones, but this was a really good one. </p>
    <p> Report: 10 ppl and a dog (coby <3), 3 ??? blankets, kava, dutch cookies made from the pit of a fruit .... ! </p>
    <p> We had six new attendees -- one of whom I've been following on twitter for years, but had never met in real life (what a pleasure!!).</p>
    <p> Coby, an adorable little ombre smudge, was also attending for his first time (see below).     
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenholmberg/willardwednesday.club/main/img/20240717_coby.JPG" alt="sweetie" style="width:50%;height:auto;">
    <p> We drank Kava and talked about systems design, cell membranes, and trips people are going on.</p>
    <p> We probably talked about more stuff but I'm writing this report late so I don't remember. </p>
    <p> another life affirming WW.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>üñºÔ∏è Wednesday, July 10th 2024</h2>
    <p>Report: 12 ppl and a dog (wally <3), 5 blankets (?), random food items I forgot to remember, a parachute (thank you V). <br>
        We ran around with the parachute and figured out how to make a good dome. <br>
        The bubble team came at the end and celebrated a friends‚Äô birthday with two cakes (See one of the cakes (baked by D) below). <br>
        Hanging out in a park with others continues to be great‚Ä¶ so obvious, yet so profound.</p><br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>Two new friends showed up to this Willard Wednesday (R and C). <br>
        B shared Willard Wednesday with a friend, who in return shared a flyer she had seen in Berkeley advertising a picnic at Willard Park (organized by R and C).<br>
        Everyone is on the same wavelength ‚Äî we need to 1) touch grass and 2) socialize. <br>
        We promptly emailed the address on the flyer and invited them to join -- and they joined!!! <br>
        Everyone needs to hang out in Willard Park.</p><br>
    <p>Anyway, V heard this origin story and remembered a set of flyers that she loved, which I have attached below. </p>

    <p>‚ÄúOther inspiring flyers from the neighborhood, inspired by the convergence of strangers on the behalf of posted flyers‚Ä¶‚Äù -V</p>
    <br>
    <p>In other news, I added a public log to the site. <br>
        Go to the front page of this website and you‚Äôll see a link below the one that brought you here titled ‚Äòpublic log‚Äô. <br>
        I guess if you‚Äôre on this page you‚Äôve probably already clicked the public log. <br>
        Anyway, it‚Äôs a huge text page where you can write whatever. <br>
        I‚Äôd like to create a public comment/forum section for this website eventually but I‚Äôm still figuring out the best way to do it with github. </p>

    <h2>üñºÔ∏è Wednesday, July 3rd 2024</h2>
    <p>Report: 10 people (K, M, B, A, M, V, G, J, M, B)!!!!!!!!!!!, 3 blankets, white claws, bushemi, many chips. </p>
    <p>This is what I posted day-of: "yo we're chilling by the big refwood in its shade. white claws and chipd are here. roll up!!!"</p>
    <p>I read aloud an html poem-list I wrote for my myspace in 2008. Below is Willard Wednesday's shorter communal rendition: </p>

    <h2>üñºÔ∏è Wednesday, June 25th 2024</h2>
    <p>Report: 3 people, 2 blankets, B brought water kefir to share. It was delicious.</p>
    <p>We didn't take any pictures, but below is B's addition to the log.</p>
    <p>My main takeaway from this willard wednesday was that spending time with friends in a park is great, and that we should all keep moving toward connection.</p>
    <p>We're going to make a mailing list. Email <strong>willardwednesday.club@gmail.com</strong> if you want to be on it.</p>

    <h2>üñºÔ∏è Wednesday, June 12th 2024</h2>
    <p>It was awesome I loved it. Really nice day, lots of dogs, people making huge bubbles.</p>
    <p>Grilling in Willard was easier than we thought it would be. Everything turned out great.</p>
    <p>Q brought a grill and shrimp skewers, J brought asparagus, E brought cherries and ros√©, and B brought homemade ICECREAM!</p>
    <p>No dogs joined us but some did come up and say hey.</p>
    <p>Everyone at WW had their swag on so no one got 'loser of the week' designation. </p>

    <h2>üñºÔ∏è Wednesday, June 5th 2024</h2>
    <p>We had our first Willard Wednesday.</p>
    <p>We learned that we need to bring sweaters for dusk, that the theme for the summer is "summer", and that dogs should join us.<br>
    S brought heinies and groc-out snacks, Q brought a soccer ball, everyone else brought good energy. Also some people brought blankets.<br>
    At the end we contemplated giving out "loser of the week" designation, for the friend that has had the worst week so far...<br>
    I think people had a good time.... I guess we'll see who shows up again</p>
    <p>Here is the invite I sent to people, as well as two pictures from this Willard Wednesday:</p>
