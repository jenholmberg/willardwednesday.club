## Looking forward... to next week:
Next week, on **June 12th**, 2024, we will chill again in Willard Park.  
We sat at the grey dot on the map below last time -- I'm sure we'll sit somewhere close to here again.  
Please bring a blanket if you can, as well as a sweater because it gets cold at dusk.  
We're going to grill -- so bring some grilling food.  
Hope to see you then!
