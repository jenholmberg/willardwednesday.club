        💬 There is now a willard wednesday group chat on signal -- contact Jen @ 763.202.2127 (or whoever you know that goes to ww) to add you!

    <h2> 🖼️ General Information </h2>
    <p style="line-height:134%"> Willard Wednesday began in May 2024 as a standing invitation to hang out in Willard Park on Wednesday evenings (see log). <br>
        It was a key highlight of my summer. I love to chat with friends, and I love to spend time in the park :')<br>
        Unfortunately, the sun sets too early now (6:45pm today 😔), and we will enter the rainy season soon. 
        But we will keep hanging out, and we're in the phase of figuring out where to "winterize" Willard Wednesdays.<br>
        Sometimes we meet in the park first, but sometimes we don't, and most of our coordination occurs in the signal chat. <br>
        Please reach out if you would like to be added! </p>
        Lastly, while Willard Wednesday is winterized, this page will be on hiatus. Check back next May :-)! ❄️🧤</p>
<!--     <p>👀 What?: A standing invitation to hang out in a Berkeley park on Wednesday evenings this <strike>summer</strike> fall.</p>
    <p>🗺️ Where?: Until sundown, Willard Park. Generally around the grey dot on the map below. After sunset, we meander to potential spots to winterize willard wednesday.</p>
    <p>⏰ When?: Starting at 5 or 5:30 in the park (for now), then at sundown we go somewhere else.</p>

<!--     <h2> 🔮 Anything special going on for the next WW on September 25th, 2024? [[update:20240922]]</h2>
    <p> Once again, chilling in the park together is special enough :-)... Invite your friends.</p>
    <p> Also -- if there are any day-of updates, like if we're located in a different spot, I'll update this section with info. .</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hope to see you then!</p>
