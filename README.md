### Wednesday, June 5th 2024
We had our first Willard Wednesday.

We learned that we need to bring sweaters for dusk, that the theme for the summer is "summer", and that dogs should join us.  
S brought heinies and groc-out snacks, Q brought a soccer ball, everyone else brought good energy. Also some people brought blankets.  
At the end we contemplated giving out "loser of the week" designation, for the friend that has had the worst week so far...
I think people had a good time.... I guess we'll see who shows up again, and judge based simply on that.......
  
Here are two pictures from this Willard Wednesday:
