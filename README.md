# Willard Wednesday üõù
[log](log.html) , [info](info.html)

## Information for next week, **June 12th, 2024**
Next week, on **June 12th**, 2024, we will chill again in Willard Park.  
We sat at the grey dot on the map below last time -- I'm sure we'll sit somewhere close to that point again.  
Please bring a blanket if you can, as well as a sweater because it gets cold at dusk.
Feel free to bring a soccer ball, frisbee, whatever.
And -- excitingly!! -- we're going to grill! So bring some grilling food if you want to partake.
Hope to see you then!
