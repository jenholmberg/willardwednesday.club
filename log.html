    <h1>üìù Willard Wednesday log</h1>

    <h2>üñºÔ∏è Wednesday, June 25th 2024</h2>
    <p>Report: 3 people, 2 blankets, B brought water kefir to share. It was delicious.</p>
    <p>We didn't take any pictures, but below is B's addition to the log.</p>
    <p>My main takeaway from this willard wednesday was that spending time with friends in a park is great, and that we should all keep moving toward connection.</p>
    <p>We're going to make a mailing list. Email <strong>willardwednesday.club@gmail.com</strong> if you want to be on it.</p>

    <h2>üñºÔ∏è Wednesday, June 12th 2024</h2>
    <p>It was awesome I loved it. Really nice day, lots of dogs, people making huge bubbles.</p>
    <p>Grilling in Willard was easier than we thought it would be. Everything turned out great.</p>
    <p>Q brought a grill and shrimp skewers, J brought asparagus, E brought cherries and ros√©, and B brought homemade ICECREAM!</p>
    <p>No dogs joined us but some did come up and say hey.</p>
    <p>Everyone at WW had their swag on so no one got 'loser of the week' designation. </p>

    <h2>üñºÔ∏è Wednesday, June 5th 2024</h2>
    <p>We had our first Willard Wednesday.</p>
    <p>We learned that we need to bring sweaters for dusk, that the theme for the summer is "summer", and that dogs should join us.<br>
    S brought heinies and groc-out snacks, Q brought a soccer ball, everyone else brought good energy. Also some people brought blankets.<br>
    At the end we contemplated giving out "loser of the week" designation, for the friend that has had the worst week so far...<br>
    I think people had a good time.... I guess we'll see who shows up again</p>
    <p>Here is the invite I sent to people, as well as two pictures from this Willard Wednesday:</p>
