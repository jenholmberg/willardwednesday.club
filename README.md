## Looking forward... to next week:
Next week, on **June 12th**, 2024, we will chill again in Willard Park.  
We sat at the grey dot on the map below last time -- I'm sure we'll sit somewhere close to here again.  
Please bring a blanket if you can, as well as a sweater because it gets cold at dusk.  
We're going to grill -- so bring some grilling food.  
Hope to see you then!

### Wednesday, June 5th 2024
We had our first Willard Wednesday.

We learned that we need to bring sweaters for dusk, that the theme for the summer is "summer", and that dogs should join us.  
S brought heinies and groc-out snacks, Q brought a soccer ball, everyone else brought good energy. Also some people brought blankets.  
At the end we contemplated giving out "loser of the week" designation, for the friend that has had the worst week so far...
I think people had a good time.... I guess we'll see who shows up again, and judge based simply on that.......
  
Here are two pictures from this Willard Wednesday:
