### Wednesday, June 5th 2024
We had our first Willard Wednesday on June 5th, 2024.  

We learned that we need to bring sweaters for dusk, that the theme for the summer is "summer", and that dogs should join us.  
S brought heinies and groc-out snacks, Q brought a soccer ball, everyone else brought good energy.  
At the end we contemplated giving out "friend of the week" designation, though I forget what the specific designation was supposed to be...  
Here are two pictures from Willard Wednesday:
